# customer-churn
A machine learning project to predict customer churn and analyze churn factors

# 📦 Customer Churn Prediction Project

> **“Will this customer leave us?”**  
This end-to-end machine learning project dives deep into customer behavior to predict churn, analyze key patterns, and build real business insights — all backed by Python and Power BI.

## 📊 Business Problem

Churn is one of the biggest challenges for subscription-based businesses.  
**This project helps identify:**
- Who is likely to churn?
- What features affect customer retention?
- How to visualize churn insights for management?

## 🧠 Key Learnings

- Feature encoding for ML (binary mapping, one-hot)
- Handling NaNs and data types properly
- Logistic Regression as a baseline classifier
- Model evaluation using accuracy, precision, recall, F1, and ROC-AUC
- Business communication through Power BI visuals

---

## 📈 Model Performance

- 📊 **Logistic Regression Accuracy**: ~80%
- ✅ Model trained on clean, imputed, well-encoded features
- 📉 ROC Curve plotted for probability-based evaluation

---

## 📉 Power BI Dashboard (Coming Soon)

The cleaned dataset was used to design a **dynamic Power BI dashboard** with:
- Churn by Gender, Tenure, Contract Type
- Monthly Charges trends
- Slicers for Internet Service, Senior Citizen, Payment Method, etc.
